## Study Guide! 

### By Erik Irgens

### About
During your time at Epicodus, you've probably already noticed that there are a large amount of commands and various places to put them. It can be hard to keep track of them, and I actually recommend that you all create your own cheat sheets. You're welcome to use this as a reference for now if you'd like, or even fork this repository and add to it! 

This repository contains multiple items, such as VSCode shortcut references, terminal commands, and other helpful tips and tricks. 

This project will also act as a hub for commands you might need to quickly reference. You may even consider making this a study guide for yourself! :)
